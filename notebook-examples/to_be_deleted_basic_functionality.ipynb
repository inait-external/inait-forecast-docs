    "## ⚙️ Configuration Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll configure the following parameters for our prediction:\n",
    "- **Model**: Using `\"basic\"` for a simple, interpretable forecast\n",
    "- **Data**: Power consumption data from Germany (`demo_power.csv`)\n",
    "- **Target Column**: `DE_Spot_EPEX_1H_A` (German electricity spot prices)\n",
    "- **Exogenous Features**: `DE_Residual_Load_15M_A_AVG` and `DE_Consumption_15M_A_AVG` \n",
    "- **Forecasting Horizon**: 10 time steps into the future\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🔍 **Why Exogenous Features Matter for Explanations**\n",

    "✅ **Multi-Source Intelligence** - Understand both autoregressive patterns and external drivers  \n",
    "✅ **Enhanced Interpretability** - Get complete transparency into model decision-making  \n",
    "✅ **Business Insights** - Connect predictions to real-world factors (load, consumption)  \n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Model Options**: You can experiment with different models:\n",
    "- `\"basic\"` - Simple and interpretable (great for understanding feature contributions)\n",
    "- `\"robust\"` - Stable with noise handling\n",
    "- `\"neural\"` - Advanced deep learning (complex feature interactions)\n",
    "- `\"gradient_boost\"` - High accuracy ensemble (sophisticated feature processing)\n",
