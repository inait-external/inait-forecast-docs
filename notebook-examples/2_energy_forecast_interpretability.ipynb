    "## Understanding What Drives the Forecast\n",
    "In this notebook we focus on interpretability, i.e., understanding why the model makes its predictions. We introduce a way to measure how much each input factor contributes to the forecast. This helps identify the key drivers behind the predictions and supports informed decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we use the German energy day-ahead hourly prediction dataset with two main features:\n",
    "- Consumption: the actual electricity demand.\n",
    "- Residual load: the demand not covered by renewable generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are several publicly available datasets for the day-ahead electricity forecasting problem, the dataset used here was built internally to capture more recent trends, including major regime shifts and outliers observed in the energy market over the past years. This allows us to benchmark forecasting models under realistic and challenging conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By examining the relative importance of these features, we can see which factors most influence the forecast at different times, enabling better operational and strategic planning."

    "We have run two models: one without features and one with features. The model with features demonstrates higher accuracy. The explanation plot shows that consumption and residual load—the two external drivers—are important contributors to the prediction. These variables complement the price input, which remains a key driver on its own. While domain knowledge is valuable for the initial selection of candidate features, the `explain` feature then reveals exactly which variables the model finds most important. This combination of expert intuition and data-driven explanation helps enhance both model performance and interpretability."
