    "## Understanding What Drives the Forecast\n",
    "In this notebook, we focus on interpretability, i.e., understanding why the model makes its predictions. We introduce a way to measure how much each input factor contributes to the forecast. This helps identify the key drivers behind the predictions and supports informed decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we use the German energy day-ahead hourly prediction dataset with two main features:\n",
    "- Consumption: the actual electricity demand.\n",
    "- Residual load: the demand not covered by renewable generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By examining the relative importance of these features, we can see which factors most influence the forecast at different times, enabling better operational and strategic planning."

Each forecasting horizon may have different key drivers (by default, the first forecasting horizon is shown, but you can change this).\n\nIn this example, we display the drivers for the prediction at 19:00, a classic peak time in the energy market that is notoriously difficult to forecast accurately. The bars in the plot are ordered by their importance. Each bar is labeled with a variable name (e.g., price, consumption, or residual load) and a time reference in the format `t-1`, `t-2`, â€¦, `t-observation_length`.\n\nThis time reference indicates which historical time step of that variable is influential. For example, if `price (t-1)` appears in the top 10, it means that  most recent observation of the price variable is among the most important predictors."
